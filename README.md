## Vehicle Steering Angle Prediction using ConvNets
This project consists of designing, training, and evaluating an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline to perform the steering of a self-driving car. A simulator provided by Udacity was used to collect training data and to test the performance. Click on the image below for a video of the car driving in autonomous mode. A write-up is also available [www.lrgonzales.com/steering-angle-pred](http://www.lrgonzales.com/steering-angle-pred).

### Introduction
The steering of a vehicle is a complex problem faced by self-driving vehicles, particularly given the various colors and patterns of lane markings present in the real-world. In addition, lane markings can be obscured by obstacles and wear and tear. Moreover, it's possible that lanes/pathways don't contain any markings and are expected to be inferred (one-way streets, alleyways, etc). It's also critical that a system designed to perform the steering of a self-driving car be robust to varied weather, road surfaces, and lighting conditions. CNNs are an attractive solution to this task given their ability to learn abstract concepts.

### Simulator
A simulator (startup screen shown in Fig. 1) provided by Udacity (download for [Linux](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae46bb_linux-sim/linux-sim.zip), [Mac](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae4594_mac-sim.app/mac-sim.app.zip), [Windows](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/58ae4419_windows-sim/windows-sim.zip)) was used to collect training data in training mode and to test the performance of the CNN in autonomous mode.

### Dataset
Fig. 1 shows a sampling of the dataset used, the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news), such that each row corresponds to a unique class. Each sample is shown in the actual resolution used by the CNN — 32 x 32. There are a total of 43 different classes. Below is a histogram of the classes in the training, validation, and test sets. The correspondence between traffic sign name and label can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LY-oqEmVAUGnINt9lnoH23MOkB6cFZT3/view).

Preprocessing consists of resizing all of the images to a dimension of 32 x 32 x 3 (RGB), converting to grayscale [2], and normalizing from [0,255] to [−1,1).

Referring to Fig. 1, note that the dataset includes slight rotations, blurring, differing levels of brightness, and even glare within each class. Given the varied representations built into the dataset, data augmentation was not implemented. If data augmentation were to be considered, note that the oft-used vertical flip would be detrimental to some classes (e.g., last two rows of Fig. 1).

### CNN Architecture and Training
The CNN architecture is inspired by ResNet and incorporates one skip-connection. A complete diagram of the architecture, depicting the activation layers, is shown below with the preprocessing layers omitted for brevity.

The learning rate and batch size were treated as hyperparameters during the training process. Once both parameters were tuned, the final training procedure included a decay of the learning rate after 80 epochs, as shown below alongside the learning curves. The model was trained using dropout on the fully-connected layers, cross-entropy loss with a final softmax activation layer, and the Adam optimizer.

### Performance
The model achieves 98.2% accuracy on the validation set. To get a better sense for the specific errors made by the model, a confusion matrix (available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YFQTteYdOAVHGGs9GsegFDHA0cik9tw/view)) was captured using the validation set. Note that the values in the confusion matrix were rounded to a single decimal place and values less than 0.1 are left unannotated.

Fig. 5 shows examples of the errors made on the validation set, identified using the confusion matrix. The labels corresponding to the depicted traffic signs are included. All true labels in Fig. 5 had a limited number of examples (approximately 200) in the training set. As a result, data augmentation of these classes would likely reduce future errors. It's also worth noting that the third error depicted in Fig. 5 (true of 24, predicted of 18) only occurred for extremely dark examples with a label of 24. Note that the examples shown in Fig. 5 are not of the resolution used by the CNN (48 x 48, as opposed to 32 x 32).

The test set accuracy is 97.8%. The corresponding confusion matrix for the test set is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzWLoy17UiSOwDMT3N05WM803AZBUwNo/view) and also points to errors likely being a result of limited representation of specific labels in the training set.

### Improvements
Beyond using data augmentation for classes with limited representation, increasing the image resolution may improve performance; however, the tradeoff would be increased run-time, an important aspect in practice.

### Usage
Run `./init.sh` to obtain the dataset in `./data/` and the saved TensorFlow model in `./tf_model/`.

#### Training
Run `python ./src/sign_classifier_train.py` to train the model. The trained TensorFlow model saves to `./tf_model/`. the chosen values for The chosen values for the hyperparameters (learning rate and batch size) are predefined in `./src/sign_classifier_train.py`, but these can be changed by redefining `alpha` and `batch_sz`.

#### Inference
Inference can be performed by running `python ./src/sign_classifier_inference.py <img>` where `<img>` is a 32 x 32 RGB image compatible with `cv2.imread()`. As an example, `twenty_kph.png`, a compatible image of a 20 KPH speed limit sign, is included in `./imgs/`. To perform inference on this image, run `python ./src/sign_classifier_inference.py ./imgs/twenty_kph.png`.

### Dependencies
The project makes use of `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, `cv2`, and `gdrive`.
